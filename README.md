help with learning fitplc

The function now works but I am still dependent on plyr for many things.  Are there
more modern techniques (tidyverse stuff) that I shoudl be using instead?

I need to work in some warning/stops into the function but I can do that later

Now that it works can you give run some examples of all the things fitplc can do?

Cheers!!


EXP:
lots of fern species with terrestrial and epiphytic as the factors (not assigned in this subset)

4-6 vulnerability curves per species

all stipes were de-gassed prior to measurement, so Kmax is 0.0Mpa

I have included just two species for ease, but the function has been tested on the
las selva data set which is 6 species.
